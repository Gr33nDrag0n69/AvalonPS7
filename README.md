# AvalonPS7


## Why this project

Canaan Avalon home miners are built to be managed by android using Avalon Family App.

To manage miners from a PC, I found the following methods:

* Web Interface: Require a QR code to be scan with the `Avalon Family App` each time.
* FMS Software: Never detected miners... Need more testing.
* AvalonMinerViewer: A shady russian software. It is infected with a virus.

The goal of this project is to communicate directly with the miners from PowerShell 7.
